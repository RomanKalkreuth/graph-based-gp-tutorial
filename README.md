# Graph-based Genetic Programming Tutorial 

## About the tutorial

Although the classical way to represent programs in Genetic Programming (GP) is by means of an expression tree, different GP variants with alternative representations have been proposed throughout the years. One such representation is the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG), adopted by methods like Cartesian Genetic Programming (CGP), Linear Genetic Programming (LGP), Parallel Distributed Genetic Programming (PDGP), and, more recently, Evolving Graphs by Graph Programming (EGGP). The aim of this tutorial is to consider this methods from a unified perspective as graph-based GP, present their historical background, representation features, operators, applications, and available implementations. More specifically, we:

- Present a historical overview and taxonomy of different graph-based GP methods, giving a special focus on the fundamental aspects of the most popular ones.

- Based on a recent effort, highlight differences in how the DAG representation is used and manipulated by different graph-based methods and present initial results on how this impacts their performance and how they compare to the traditional tree representation.

- Present examples of successful applications of graph-based GP, for example, CGP applied to the design of digital circuits, neural networks and image operators.

- Demonstrate available implementations and benchmarks of some graph-based GP methods.
